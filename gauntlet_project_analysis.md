## Top 5 Recommendations for Gauntlet Program

### 1. **Universal Search** 
Build an intelligent, fast search across all PSA entities (tickets, accounts, projects, inventory). Include filters, recent searches, and AI-powered suggestions. This addresses a critical daily need for all users.

### 2. **Mobile App (Field Service Focus)**
Create a React Native app focused on field technician needs: ticket management, time tracking, signature capture, photo uploads, offline sync. This directly impacts service delivery efficiency.

### 3. **Workflows & Notifications Engine**
Develop a visual workflow builder with trigger-action-condition logic, supporting email/SMS/in-app notifications. Include templates for common MSP workflows (ticket escalation, SLA warnings, approval chains).

### 4. **Metered Usage Billing Module**
Implement flexible usage tracking and rating engine for any metric (API calls, storage GB, endpoints, licenses). Include usage dashboards, overage alerts, and integration with existing billing.

### 5. **AI-Powered Onboarding Assistant**
Leverage existing Ask Rev.ii technology to create an intelligent onboarding agent that guides new customers through setup, imports data, suggests configurations, and provides contextual help.

## Alternative Strong Candidates

- **Commerce Hub (Phase 2)**: Full procurement and payment processing capability, transforming lead generation into complete marketplace
- **Sales Opportunity Management**: If sales pipeline visibility is a critical gap
- **Visualization Framework**: If data insights and reporting need modernization

## Implementation Strategy

### Team Allocation (5 people, 2 projects each)
- **Person 1**: Universal Search (primary) + Mobile App (secondary)
- **Person 2**: Mobile App (primary) + Workflows Engine (secondary)
- **Person 3**: Workflows Engine (primary) + Metered Billing (secondary)
- **Person 4**: Metered Billing (primary) + AI Onboarding (secondary)
- **Person 5**: AI Onboarding (primary) + Universal Search (secondary)

This creates natural handoffs and collaboration between team members.

### Success Factors
1. **Week 1-3 (Remote)**: Requirements, design, architecture, prototype
2. **Week 4-6 (On-site)**: Intensive development, integration, testing, demo prep
3. **Daily Standups**: Cross-project coordination
4. **Weekly Demos**: Show progress to stakeholders
5. **Integration Points**: Plan API contracts early
6. **Testing Strategy**: Automated tests from day one

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with MVPs, add features iteratively
- Use existing Rev.io AI capabilities (Ask Rev.ii) where possible
- Leverage proven libraries and frameworks
- Plan for integration testing in week 5
- Reserve week 6 for polish and demo preparation

## Expected Outcomes
By end of Gauntlet program, Rev.io PSA will have:
1. Significantly improved user productivity (search)
2. Better field service capabilities (mobile)
3. Advanced automation (workflows)
4. Modern billing flexibility (metered usage)
5. Reduced onboarding friction (AI assistant)

These additions will position Rev.io PSA as a truly modern, AI-first platform that stands out from legacy PSA competitors.
